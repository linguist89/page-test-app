            <h2>About Ducks</h2>
            <p>Ducks are remarkable waterfowl that have captivated humans for centuries. These fascinating creatures belong to the family Anatidae, which includes swans and geese. Ducks can be found on every continent except Antarctica, showcasing their incredible adaptability to different environments.</p>
            
            <h3>Physical Characteristics</h3>
            <p>Ducks are characterized by their waterproof feathers, webbed feet, and distinctive bills. Their bodies are perfectly adapted for life both in water and on land. The waterproof feathers are maintained by an oil gland that produces a special secretion that ducks spread across their feathers during preening.</p>
            
            <h3>Behavior and Habitat</h3>
            <p>Ducks are highly social animals that often live in large groups called rafts. They communicate through a variety of vocalizations and body language. While most species are excellent swimmers and divers, different species have evolved to thrive in various habitats, from woodland ponds to coastal waters.</p>
            
            <h3>Conservation</h3>
            <p>While many duck species are thriving, some face challenges due to habitat loss and climate change. Conservation efforts worldwide focus on protecting wetlands and maintaining healthy duck populations through sustainable practices and habitat preservation.</p>
